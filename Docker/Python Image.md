### Docker: Web Application Containerization
1. Write a Dockerfile to containerize a sample application. You can find app code in this folder.
2. Use multi-stage builds to reduce the final image size.Define a health check in the Dockerfile to ensure the app is responding as expected.
3. Test the app to see "Hello World" from the container
4. Tag and push the Docker image to ECR.
5. Document how to run and test the container locally, including instructions on checking logs and accessing the app.
