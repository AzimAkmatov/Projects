Deploy a multi-container application using Kubernetes. Create and manage a namespace, deploy pods for different services (like frontend, backend, and database), and set up inter-service communication.

Requirements:
Use ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment configuration.
Implement resource limits for CPU and memory on each service.
Enable auto-scaling on specific services based on CPU utilization.
